Metal LB in Kubernetes provides Layer 2 (ARP) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) support, allowing for flexible IP address 
management and advertisement. In bare-metal environments, Metal LB extends Kubernetes capabilities by allocating and 
managing external IP addresses for services, seamlessly integrating with the network topology and distributing load across 
cluster nodes. This enables users to define Load Balancer services in Kubernetes, with Metal LB handling the allocation of 
external IP addresses and load balancing for those services, even in the absence of cloud providers.
